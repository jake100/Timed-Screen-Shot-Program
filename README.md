Timed-Screen-Shot-Program
=========================
use the slider to set the amount of seconds until the program takes the screenshot then press the button to start the countdown.
The program saves the screenshots in the desktop and increments the number that will be stuck unto the end of the file name so it starts at 0 then finds a number that isn't taken already.
